- [WIP] optim-rust contains scripts I wrote for one of my uni courses implementing optimization algorithms in Rust. The focus was on learning the concepts while at the same time learning Rust.
    - [ ] tabu search
    - [ ] simulated annealing
    - [ ] genetic algorithm
- [WIP] ml-api-rust contains an API that can be used to automatically train and evaluate machine learning models.
    - [ ] post data to API
    - [ ] train model and specify a schedule for training
    - [ ] get inference on new examples
